# sprydrive
SpryDrive is an affordable actuator based on the quasi-direct drive (QDD) scheme. It is composed of a brushless outrunner motor, a low-cost metal gearbox, and a 3D-printed housing. Inspired by Gabrael Levine's OpenTorque actuator, but takes up less volume. The lower cost of the smaller bearing makes up for the added cost of the steel gears. Output Backlash: ~0.13 degree  Gear Ratio: 7:1  Motor: Herlea X8318S or Turnigy 9235

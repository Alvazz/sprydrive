# sprydrive
SpryDrive is an affordable actuator based on the quasi-direct drive (QDD) scheme. It is composed of a brushless outrunner motor, a low-cost metal gearbox, and a 3D-printed housing. Inspired by Gabrael Levine's OpenTorque actuator, but takes up less volume.

Output Backlash: ~0.13 degree  
Gear Ratio: 7:1  
Motor: Herlea X8318S or Turnigy 9235

The 8318 motor and 9235 motor are nearly identical, but the 8318 is 3 mm longer. Thus why there are two versions of the model. Keep this in mind when ordering parts.
